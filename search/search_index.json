Note that the guides are present to help you simplify your tasks - but as an entity responsible for creating blocks on a financial platform, we expect the pre-requisite skill sets - at professional level - before entering the portal: Learn about working with architecture, setup and essentials (SysOps); Understand how to secure your server (SecOps); Be comfortable with working with cardano-cli , and have worked on testnet for pool operations without use of wrapper scripts - as an education exercise; Read the documentation and disclaimers. The guide and tools only aim to simplify your tasks, it will not try to do everything for you - neither scope best practices. We recommend anyone using these instructions to use offline workflow, and NEVER have their wallet keys and pool keys to be made available to online servers, as supported by the tools. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the repository (via documentation, testing, code, videos, etc). Our aim is to work together and reduce confusion rather than hosting 100 versions of documentation - each marketing their pool in a way.

We look forward to more contributions and working together. Preface for Upgrade \u2693\ufe0e Given the increase in usage and adoptability of the scripts, we have seen some repetitive requests as well as learnt that if we are to keep adding features, we need to rewrite the scripts to accommodate: Update components in place Handle Multiple Networks using flags - reducing manual download of file/configs. Retain User customisations, while trying to reduce number of files (topology, custom ports, paths, etc) Re-use code as much as possible, instead of re-writing across scripts Have better workflow for troubleshooting using alternate git branches Standardise the method of accessing information and use EKG as much as possible This was merged nicely with the addition of CNTools Offline transaction signing and online creation/submission process (details here ) We also use this opportunity to make some changes to topologyUpdater script to not require a separate fetch call, and let variables be defined using consistent manner, including custom peers for own relays. @gufmar has modified the backend service, to at least provide a minimal viable topology file (includes IOG peers along with custom ones) in case you're not allowed to fetch yet. Some or all of the above required us to rewrite some artifacts in a way that is more future proof, but is not too much of a hassle to existing users of guild scripts.

Note that it is imperative for operational relays and pools to ensure that the port mentioned is opened via firewall to the destination your node is supposed to connect from. Update your network/firewall configuration accordingly. Future executions of prereqs.sh will preserve and not overwrite these values. CNODE_PORT = 6000 POOL_NAME = \"GUILD\" POOL_NAME is the name of folder that you will use when registering pools and starting node in core mode. This folder would typically contain your hot.skey , vrf.skey and op.cert files required. If the mentioned files are absent, the node will automatically start in a passive mode. Start the node \u2693\ufe0e To test starting the node in interactive mode, you can use the pre-built script below ( cnode.sh ) (note that your node logs are being written to $CNODE_HOME/logs folder, you may not see much output beyond Listening on http://127.0.0.1:12798 ). This script automatically determines whether to start the node as a relay or block producer (if the required pool keys are present in the $CNODE_HOME/priv/pool/<POOL_NAME> as mentioned above). The script contains a user-defined variable CPU_CORES which determines the number of CPU cores the node will use upon start-up: ###################################### # User Variables - Change as desired # # Common variables set in env file # ###################################### #CPU_CORES=2 # Number of CPU cores cardano-node process has access to (please don't set higher than physical core count, 2-4 recommended) You can uncomment this and set to the desired number, but be wary not to go above your physical core count. cd $CNODE_HOME /scripts ./cnode.sh Stop the node by hitting Ctrl-C.

Start the node Run below commands to enable automatic start of service on startup and start it. sudo systemctl start cnode.service 3. Check status and stop/start commands Replace status with stop / start / restart depending on what action to take. sudo systemctl status cnode.service ?> In case you see the node exit unsuccessfully upon checking status, please verify you've followed the transition process correctly as documented below, and that you do not have another instance of node already running. It would help to check your system logs ( /var/log/syslog for debian-based and /var/log/messages for Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora systems) for any errors while starting node.

PostgREST is a web server that serves any PostgreSQL database (in our case, useful for cardano-db-sync and smash ) as a RESTful Web Service. The endpoints of PostgREST in itself are essentially the table itself. You can read more about exploring the API here . Understandably, it would of course rely on an existing PostgreSQL server. At the moment of writing, this is being used as an easy alternative - which will remain up-to-date since it is directly serving the underlying database as an API, as compared to Cardano GraphQL component. Some of the other advantages would also be that you can serve JWT authentication, or use native Postgres DB authentication against the Rest Interface as well (see here for adding this to your instance), and the web server it uses can be hardened or served behind another nginx/httpd/.. reverse proxy as per your SecOps preferences. Again, the focus of this guide (for now) is not to tell you how to secure your PostgREST instance, but to get you up and running quickly. You'd want to harden your instance as per instructions here once you're happy with the usage. The guide below assumes PostgreSQL instance has already been set up (refer to Sample Local PostgreSQL Server Deployment instructions ) along with cardano-db-sync . Prepare Database \u2693\ufe0e For simplicity, the download of latest PostgREST instance is already available via executing the below: mkdir ~/tmp ; cd ~/tmp wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/prereqs.sh ./prereqs.sh -p This would download and make postgrest binary available in ${HOME}/.cabal/bin which is also where your DB Sync binaries would be, assuming you've followed this guide . To start with you'd want to ensure your current shell session has access to Postgres credentials, continuing from examples from the above mentioned Sample Postgres deployment guide . cd $CNODE_HOME /priv PGPASSFILE = $CNODE_HOME /priv/.pgpass Now you'd want to start psql cexplorer to connect to your Postgres Instance, and create a basic user and give it usage/select access to the schema and tables respectively. Refer to commands below for the same: create role web_anon nologin ; grant usage on schema public to web_anon ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO web_anon ; ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO web_anon ; You can now quit your psql session using \\q . Create Config and Start PostgREST \u2693\ufe0e Now that your user is created in database, you can create the postgrest config. A basic sample is below: !> Replace ${USER} and ${PASSWORD} to match the username and password you can authenticate with for psql (defined in $CNODE_HOME/priv/.pgpass file in our example). cat << 'EOF' > $CNODE_HOME/priv/pgrest.conf db-uri = \"postgres://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@localhost/cexplorer\" db-schema = \"public\" db-anon-role = \"web_anon\" server-host = \"127.0.0.1\" server-port = 8050 #jwt-secret = \"secret-token\" #db-pool = 10 #db-pool-timeout = 10 #db-extra-search-path = \"public\" #max-rows = 1000 EOF If you'd like to connect to your PostgREST remotely (again, it is recommended you harden your instance before this is done), uncomment and replace the server-host parameter with \"0.0.0.0\"). Make sure to change the file permissions so that it's only visible to user that will run postgrest instance using chmod 600 $CNODE_HOME/priv/pgrest.conf . If you want to prevent unauthenticated access, uncomment the jwt-secret and specify a custom secret-token . You're now all set! To start the instance, you can use the below to start your postgrest instance. postgrest $CNODE_HOME /priv/pgrest.conf ## Attempting to connect to the database... ## Listening on port 8050 ## Connection successful Test queries \u2693\ufe0e While you can query PostgREST a browser from a browser if listening on 0.0.0.0 , we'd stick to querying your instance via curl on terminal, so that we're not troubleshooting any firewall/network configuration issues. Now, the nomenclature we used should have connected you to the cardano-db-sync instance. Assuming it is already populated (even partially), you can try explore tables as REST endpoints. To query the network your DBSync instance has connected to curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8050/meta?select = network_name ## [{\"network_name\":\"mainnet\"}] curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8050/meta?network_name | jq -r '.[].network_name' ## mainnet Note that here meta is the table name, while network_name is the column name. Let's now look at another table epoch and add a WHERE filter to query ID equals 2. curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8050/epoch?id = eq.2 | jq . ## [ ## { ## \"id\": 2, ## \"out_sum\": 101402912214214220, ## \"fees\": 1033002678, ## \"tx_count\": 12870, ## \"blk_count\": 21590, ## \"no\": 1, ## \"start_time\": \"2017-09-28T21:44:51\", ## \"end_time\": \"2017-10-03T21:44:31\" ## } ## ] Refer to API documentation for more details about querying (joins, functions, custom queries, stored procedures, etc).","title":"PostgREST"},{"location":"Build/pgrest/#prepare-database","text":"For simplicity, the download of latest PostgREST instance is already available via executing the below: mkdir ~/tmp ; cd ~/tmp wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/prereqs.sh ./prereqs.sh -p This would download and make postgrest binary available in ${HOME}/.cabal/bin which is also where your DB Sync binaries would be, assuming you've followed this guide .

It's a community-based CLI tool written in RUST for low-level cardano-node communication. Usage is optional and no script is dependent on it. The main features include: PING - Validates that the remote server is on the given network and returns its response time. Utilized by gLiveView for peer analysis if available. SYNC - Connects to a node (local or remote) and synchronizes blocks to a local sqlite database. VALIDATE - Validates that a block hash or partial block hash is on-chain. LEADERLOG - Calculates a stakepool's expected slot list. On the mainnet and the official testnet, the next epoch's leader schedule is available 1.5 days before the end of the epoch ( firstSlotOfNextEpoch - (3 * k / f) ). SENDTIP - Send node tip to PoolTool for network analysis and to show that your node is alive and well with a green badge. SENDSLOTS - Securely sends PoolTool the number of slots you have assigned for an epoch and validates the correctness of your past epochs. Installation \u2693\ufe0e cncli.sh script's main functions, sync , leaderlog , validate and PoolTool sendslots / sendtip are not meant to be run manually, but instead deployed as systemd services that run in the background to do the block scraping and validation automatically. Additional commands exist for manual execution to initiate the sqlite db, filling the blocklog DB with all blocks created by the pool known to the blockchain, migration of old cntoolsBlockCollector JSON blocklog, and re-validation of blocks and leaderlogs. See usage output below for a complete list of available commands. The script works in tandem with Log Monitor to provide faster adopted status but mainly to catch slots the node is leader for but are unable to create a block for. These are marked as invalid. Blocklog will however work fine without the logMonitor service and CNCLI is able to handle everything except catching invalid blocks. Run the latest version of prereqs.sh with prereqs.sh -c to download and install RUST and CNCLI. IOG fork of libsodium required by CNCLI is automatically compiled by CNCLI build process. If a previous installation is found, RUST and CNCLI will be updated to the latest version. Run deploy-as-systemd.sh to deploy the systemd services that handle all the work in the background. Six systemd services in total are deployed whereof four are related to CNCLI. See above for the different purposes they serve. If you want to disable some of the deployed services, run sudo systemctl disable <service> cnode.service (main cardano-node launcher) cnode-cncli-sync.service cnode-cncli-leaderlog.service cnode-cncli-validate.service cnode-cncli-ptsendtip.service cnode-cncli-ptsendslots.service cnode-logmonitor.service (see Log Monitor ) Configuration \u2693\ufe0e You can override the values in the script at the User Variables section shown below. POOL_ID , POOL_VRF_SKEY and POOL_VRF_VKEY should automatically be detected if POOL_NAME is set in the common env file and can be left commented. PT_API_KEY and POOL_TICKER need to be set in the script if PoolTool sendtip / sendslots are to be used before starting the services. For the rest of the commented values, if the defaults do not provide the right values, uncomment and make adjustments. #POOL_ID=\"\" # Automatically detected if POOL_NAME is set in env. Required for leaderlog calculation & pooltool sendtip, lower-case hex pool id #POOL_VRF_SKEY=\"\" # Automatically detected if POOL_NAME is set in env.

E.g running sudo systemctl start cnode.service will also start all child services. Make sure to set appropriate values according to Configuration section before starting services. Log output is handled by syslog and end up in the systems standard syslog file, normally /var/log/syslog . journalctl -f -u <service> can be used to check service output (follow mode). Other logging configurations are not covered here. Recommended workflow to get started with CNCLI blocklog. Install and deploy services according to Installation section. Set required user variables according to Configuration section. ( optional ) If a previous blocklog db exist created by cntoolsBlockCollector, run this command to migrate json storage to new SQLite DB: $CNODE_HOME/scripts/cncli.sh migrate <path> where is the location to the directory containing all blocks_ .json files. Start deployed services with: sudo systemctl start cnode-cncli-sync.service (starts leaderlog , validate & ptsendslots automatically) sudo systemctl start cnode-logmonitor.service sudo systemctl start cnode-cncli-ptsendtip.service ( optional but recommended ) alternatively restart the main service that will trigger a start of all services with: sudo systemctl restart cnode.service Run init command to fill the db with all blocks made by your pool known to the blockchain $CNODE_HOME/scripts/cncli.sh init Enjoy full blocklog automation and visit View Blocklog section for instructions on how to show blocks from the blocklog DB.

Used by Pool >> Show|List|Register|Modify Option to mint/burn assets in hybrid mode Transaction >> Sign now automatically tries to find the correct signing keys instead of having the user manually select the correct files ** ADVANCED FEATURE ** - Chain Queries Menu is dynamically built based on queries(JSON files) in DBSYNC_QUERY_FOLDER (env variable, default files/dbsync/queries) three levels deep. A download option lets the user download the latest uploaded queries on Guild Operators GitHub site. Query files Contains menu path, description, variables, and queries(multiple) Executes a predefined DBSync RPC/function through PostgREST API Variables used in RPC call can either be user input, CNTools variables like EKG metrics, or an item in the result from a previous query(in the same query file) Result from RPC call can either be printed or silent(only to be used for later query) Output is printed as JSON Changed \u2693\ufe0e Minimum node version bumped to 1.27.0 Menu has been re-designed with both back & home options. Instead of returning to home menu after the completed operation user is returned to the last menu. Pool >> Show now use PostgREST API(if set), or the new pool-params cli query as fallback method.

Changelog truncated up to v6.0.0. Minor and patch version changelog entries merged with next major release changelog. [8.1.1] - 2021-03-30 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Relay registration condition Version number [8.1.0] - 2021-03-26 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e IPv6 support in pool registration/modification Changed \u2693\ufe0e Wallet delegation now lets you specify Pool ID in addition to local CNTools pool instead of previous cold.vkey cbor string A couple of functions regarding number validation moved to common env file Code adapted for changes in ledger-state dump used by 'Pool >> Show' Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Backup & restore now exclude gpg encrypted keys from online backup and suppression of false alarms [8.0.2] - 2021-03-15 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Bump cardano-hw-cli minimum version to 1.2.0 Add Ledger Cardano app version check with minimum enforced version of 2.2.0 Add Trezor firmware check with minimum enforced version of 2.3.6 [8.0.1] - 2021-03-05 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Add BASH version check, version 4.4 or newer required [8.0.0] - 2021-02-28 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Multi Asset Token compatibility added throughout all CNTools operations. Sending Ada and custom tokens is done through the normal 'Funds >> Send' operation Changed \u2693\ufe0e Metadata moved to a new Advanced section used for devs/advanced operations not normally used by SPOs. Accessed by enabling developer/advanced mode in cntools.config or by providing runtime flag '-a' Redesign of backup and restore. Deletion of private keys moved from backup to new section under Advanced Backup now only contain content of priv folder (files & scripts folders dropped) Restore operation now restore directly to priv folder instead of a random user selected folder to make restore easier and better. Before restore, a new full backup of priv folder is made and stored encrypted in priv/archive Fixed \u2693\ufe0e JQ limitation workaround for large numbers Dialog compatibility improvement by preventing dialog launching a subshell on some systems causing dialog not to run [7.1.6] - 2021-02-10 \u2693\ufe0e Update curl commands when file isnt downloaded correctly (to give correct return code) [7.1.5] - 2021-02-03 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Guild Announcement/Support Telegram channel added to CNTools GUI Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Fix for a special case using an incomplete wallet (missing stake keys) [7.1.4] - 2021-02-01 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Typo in function name after harmonization between scripts [7.1.3] - 2021-01-30 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli 1.1.3 support, now the minimum supported version Improved error handling [7.1.1] - 2021-01-29 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Minor change to future update notification for common env file [7.1.0] - 2021-01-29 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Remove ChainDB metrics references to align with cardano-node 1.25.1 Moved some functions to env for reusability between tools [7.0.2] - 2021-01-17 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Re-add the option in offline workflow to use wallet folder that only contains stake keys for multi-owner pools Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Verification of signing key in offline mode for extended signing keys (mnemonics imported wallets) [7.0.1] - 2021-01-13 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Add prompt before updating common env file, instead of auto-update [7.0.0] - 2021-01-11 \u2693\ufe0e Though mostly unchanged in the user interface, this is a major update with most of the code re-written/touched in the back-end. Only the most noticeable changes added to changelog. Added \u2693\ufe0e HW Wallet support through Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli (Ledger Nano X/S & Trezor T) Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli added as build option to prereqs.sh, option '-w' incl Ledger udev rules. Software from Vacuumlabs and Ledger app still early in development and may contain limitations that require workarounds. Users are recommended to familiarise their usage using test wallets first. Because of HW wallet support, transaction signing has been re-designed. For CLI and HW wallet pool reg, raw tx is first witnessed by all signing keys separately and then assembled and signed instead of signing directly with all signing keys. But for all other HW wallet transactions, signing is done directly without first witnessing. Requires updated Cardano app in Ledger/Trezor set to be released in January 2021 to use in pool registration/modification. Option added to disable Dialog for file/dir input in cntools.config Changed \u2693\ufe0e Logging completely re-designed from the ground. Previous selective logging wasn't very useful. All output(almost) now outputted to both the screen and to a timestamped log file. One log file is created per CNTools session. Old log file archived in logs/archive subfolder and last 10 log files kept, rest is pruned on CNTools startup. DEBUG : Verbose output, most output printed on screen is logged as debug messages except explicitly disabled, like menu printing. INFO : Informational and the most important output. ACTION : e.g cardano-cli executions etc ERROR : error messages and stderr output Verbosity setting in cntools.config removed. Offline workflow now use a single JSON transaction file holding all data needed. This allows us to bake in additional data in the JSON file in addition to the tx body to make it much more clear what the offline transaction do. Like signing key verification, transaction data like fee, source wallet, pool name etc. It also lets the user know on offline computer what signing keys is needed to sign the transaction. Sign Tx moved to Transaction >> Sign Submit Tx moved to Transaction >> Submit Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Remove intermediate prompt for showing changelog, so that it's directly visible. [6.3.1] - 2020-12-14 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Array expansion not correctly handled for multi-owner signing keys KES rotation output fix in OFFLINE mode, op.cert should be copied, not cold.counter Output and file explorer workflow redesigned a bit for a better flow formatLovelace() thousand separator fix after forcing locale to C.UTF-8 in env formatAda() function added to pretty print pledge and cost w/o Lovelace [6.3.0] - 2020-12-03 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e printTable function replaced with bash printf due to compatibility issues Improved workflow in pool registration/modification for relays and multi-owner. Standardized names for wallet and pool files/folders moved to env file from cntools.config Compatibility with 1.24.2 node (accomodate ledger schema and CLI changes), use 1.24.2 as baseline Move version check to env Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Error output for prerequisite checks [6.2.1] - 2020-11-28 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Compatibility changes for cardano-node 1.23.0, now minimum version to run CNTools 6.2.1 Cleanup of old code [6.2.0] - (alpha branch) \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Ability to post metadata on-chain, e.g. (but not limited to) Adams https://vote.crypto2099.io/ Changed \u2693\ufe0e Blocks view updated to adapt to the added CNCLI integration and changes made to block collector(logMonitor) CNCLI Log Monitor chattr file locking now optional to use, a new setting in cntools.config added for it. Fixed \u2693\ufe0e unnecessary bech32 conversion in wallet import (non-breaking) [6.1.0] - 2020-10-22 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Wallet de-registration with key deposit refund (new cntools.config parameter, WALLET_STAKE_DEREG_FILENAME) Default values loaded for all config variables if omitted/missing in cntools.config Changed \u2693\ufe0e Prometheus node metrics replaced with EKG Allow and handle missing pool.config in pool >> modify and show Cancel and return added in several helper functions if cardano-cli execution fails Various tweaks to the output Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Script execution permissions after internal update Handle redirect in curl metadata fetch [6.0.3] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Shelley epoch transition calculation used the wrong byron metric in the calculation [6.0.2] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Internal update had the wrong path to env file breaking automatic update, please use prereqs.sh to update Fix in 6.0.1 broke pool id retrieval, now compatible with both pre and post cardano-node 1.21.2 syntax. [6.0.1] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e As per change to cardano-cli syntax, pool ID requires --cold-verification-key-file instead of --verification-key-file [6.0.0] - 2020-10-15 \u2693\ufe0e This is a major release with a lot of changes. It is highly recommended that you familiarise yourself with the usage for Hybrid or Online v/s Offline mode on a testnet environment before doing it on production. Please visit https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/#/upgrade for details. Added \u2693\ufe0e Allow CNTools to operate in offline mode. Offline features include: Simplified Walet Show/List menu Wallet delete without balance check option Pool KES Rotation Sign a staging transaction. Allow creation of staging tx files using ttl as input in an online/offline-hybrid mode, that can be sent to offline server to sign. To Transfer Funds Withdraw Rewards Delegate Register/Modify/Retire pool Allow import of a signed transaction to submit in online mode Allow import of 15/24 words based wallets. Note that you'd need cardano-address and bech32 in yout $PATH to use this feature (available if you rebuild cardano-node using updated cabal-build-all.sh ), reusing guide from @ilap . Backup now offer the ability to create an online backup without wallet payment/stake and pool cold sign keys Regular(offline) backup now display a warning if wallet payment/stake and pool cold sign keys are missing due to being deleted manually or by previous backup Retire notification in pool >> show Sanity check before launching a second instance of cnode.sh Doc update to run cnode.sh as a systemd service Use secure remove ( srm ) when available when deleting files. Balance check notification added before wallet selection menus are shown to know that work is done in the background Ability to select a different pool owner and reward wallet Multi-owner support using stake vkey/skey files Added TIMEOUT_LEDGER_STATE(default 300s) in cntools.config to be used instead of static 60 seconds for querying shelley ledger-state. Option to delete private keys after successful backup itnRewards.sh script to claim ITN rewards incl docs update More explicit error messages at startup Basic sanity checks for socket file Backup & Restore of wallets, pools and configuration files External KES rotation script using CNTools library Add few flags to control prereqs to allow skipping overwriting files, deploying OS packages, etc cntools.sh: Drop an error if log not found, indicating config with no JSON being used Changed \u2693\ufe0e Improved trap/exit handling Allow thousand separator( , ) in user input for sending ADA and pledge/cost at pool registration to make it easier to count the zeros User input for files and directories now open a dialog gui to make it easier to find the correct path CNTools now uses and works with cardano-node 1.19.0 , please upgrade if you're not using this version. Use manual calculation based on slot tip to get KES period Removed ledger dump dependency from Pool Register, Modify, Retire and List. The cost of the ledger dump is too high, replaced with a simple check if pools registration certificate exist in pool folder Pool >> Show|Delegators are now the only options dumping the ledger-state Wallet vkeys no longer encrypted as skeys are the only ones in need of protection Update command change (change applied after this release is active): Minor/Patch release: it will warn, backup and replace CNTools script files including cntools.config Major release: No change, prompt user to backup and run prereqs.sh according to instructions. Troubleshooting improvements: Split 'config in json format' and 'hasPrometheus' checks Output node sync stats if Shelley transition epoch is to be calculated Protocol parameters output check to give an improved error message Pool >> Show view updated to show modified pool values if Pool >> Modify has been used to update pool parameters The section has also been updated to make it a little bit easier to read Pool >> Delegators view also use updated pledge value if a pool modification has been registered to check if pledge is met Use mainnet as default, since other testnets are either retired or not being maintained :( Backup original files when doing upgrades, so that users do not lose their changes. Major update description updated env file update removed from minor update Prometheus metrics used for various functions and now required to run CNTools, enabled by default Changed references to ptn0 to generalize the usage Change CNTools changelog heading format - +1 sublevels for headings (used by newer documentation) Delegators previously displayed in Pool >> Show now moved to its own menu option This is to de-clutter and because it takes time to parse this data from ledger-state stake.cert no longer encrypted in wallet Meta description now has a limit of 255 chars to match smash server limit ledger-state timeout increased to 60s Update ptn0 config to align with hydra config as much as possible, while keeping trace options on moved update check to be one of the first things CNTools does after start to be able to show critical changes before anything else runs. Parse node logs to check the transition from Byron to shelley era, and save the epoch for transition in db folder. This is required for calculating KES keys. Please make sure to use config files created by the prereqs.sh, or enable JSON loggers for your config . Update cnode.sh.templ to archive logs every time node is restart, this ensures that we're not searching for previous log history when network was changed. Network being changed would automatically deduce db folder was deleted. Update default network to MC3 Removed \u2693\ufe0e Pool >> Delegators removed. If/when a better option than dumping and parsing ledger-state dump arise re-adding it will be considered. Utilize the community explorers listed at https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/explorers POOL_PLEDGECERT_FILENAME removed from config, WALLET_DELEGCERT_FILENAME is used instead for delegation cert to pool, no need to keep a separate cert in pool folder for this, its the wallet that is delegated. Redundant sections in guide Stale delegate.counter Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Check pool >> show stake distribution showing up as always 0. KES expiration calculation Slot interval calculation Custom vname replacement(when using prereqs.sh -t ) fix for internal update Pool registration and de-registration certificates removed in case of retire/re-registration KES Expiry to use KES Period instead of Epoch duration Block Collector script adapted for cardano-node 1.19.0. Block hash is now truncated in log, issue https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/1738 High cpu usage reported in a few cases when running Block Collector Depending on log level, parsing and byte64 enc each entry with jq could potentially put high load on weaker systems. Replaced with grep to only parse entries containing specific traces. Docs for creating systemd block collector service file updated to include user env in run command cardano-node 1.19.0 introduced an issue that required us to use KES as current - 1 while rotating. A new getPoolID helper function added to extract both hex and bech32 pool ID Added --output-format hex when extracting pool ID in hex format A new pool.id-bech32 file gets created if cold.vkey is available and decrypted Added error check to see if cardano-cli is in $PATH before continuing. Backup & Restore paths were failing on machines due to alnum class availability on certain interpreters. Rewards were not counted in stake and pledge Removed +i file locking on .addr files when using Wallet >> Encrypt as these are re-generated from keys and need to be writable Balance check added to Funds >> Withdraw for base address as this is used to pay the withdraw transaction fee Resolve issue with Multi Owner causing an error with new pool registration (error was due to quotes) Mainnet uses dedicated condition for slot checks Timeout moved to a variable in cntools.library KES Calculation for current KES period and KES expiration date Please re-check expiration date using Pool >> Show calc_slots to be network independent prom_host should be calculated from config file, instead of having to update a config Minor typo in menu Parse Config for virtual forks, which adds supports for MC4 CNTools block collector fix column application added as a prereq, bsdmainutils/util-linux cntoolsBlockCollector.sh get epoch using function KES count was not showing up in Katip Funds -> Delegation was broken as per recent changes in 1.17, corrected key type for delegation certificate Pool >> Show delegator rewards parsing from ledger-state Slot sync format improvement kesExpiration function to use 17 fixed byron transition epochs [5.0.0] - 2020-07-20 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e HASH_IDENTIFIER where applicable to differentiate between network modes for commands used, required due to legacy Byron considerations add ptn0-praos.json and ptn0-combinator.json to reduce confusion between formats, make prereqs default to combinator, and accept p argument to indicate praos mode. cardano-node 1.16.0 refers to txhash using quotes, sed them out show what's new at startup after update file size check for pool metadata file Add nonce in pool metadata JSON to keep registration attempts unique, avoiding one hash pointing to multiple URLs Change default network to mainnet_candidate , and add second argument (g) to run prereqs against guild network allow the use of pre-existing metadata from URL when registering or modifying pool minimum pool cost check against protocol Refresh option to home screen Ability to register multiple relay DNS A records as well as a mix of DNS A and IPv4 Valid for pool registration and modification Changed \u2693\ufe0e Default config switched to combinator instead of testnet Start maintaining seperate versions of praos and combinator config files. Add 10s timeout to wget commmands in case of issue timestamp added to pool metadata file to make every creation unique Cancel shortcut changed from [c] to [Esc] Default pool cost from 256 -> 400 slotinterval calculation to include decentralisation parameter mainnet candidate compatible slot calculation, 17 fixed byron transition epochs (needs to be fixed for mainnet) Pool metadata information to copy file as-is as well as wait for keypress to make sure file is copied before proceeding with registration.

When comfortable with both the online and offline CNTools workflow, it's time to deploy what you learnt on the mainnet. Create and register a stake pool \u2693\ufe0e Step by Step guide to create a pool with CNTools in Online mode: Create Wallet - a wallet is needed for pledge and to pay for pool registration fee Create Pool - create the necessary pool keys Register Pool - register the pool on-chain Create Wallet \u2693\ufe0e 1. Choose [w] Wallet and you will be presented with the following menu: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wallet Management ) New - create a new wallet ) Import - import a Daedalus/Yoroi 24/25 mnemonic or Ledger/Trezor HW wallet ) Register - register a wallet on chain ) De-Register - De-Register (retire) a registered wallet ) List - list all available wallets in a compact view ) Show - show detailed view of a specific wallet ) Remove - remove a wallet ) Decrypt - remove write protection and decrypt wallet ) Encrypt - encrypt wallet keys and make all files immutable ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Select Wallet Operation [n] New [i] Import [r] Register [z] De-Register [l] List [s] Show [x] Remove [d] Decrypt [e] Encrypt [h] Home 2. Choose [n] New to create a new wallet. [i] Import can also be used to import a Daedalus/Yoroi based 15 or 24 word wallet seed 3. Give the wallet a name 4. CNTools will give you the wallet address. For example: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET >> NEW ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Name of new wallet: Test New Wallet : Test Address : addr_test1qpq5qjr774cyc6kxcwp060k4t4hwp42q43v35lmcg3gcycu5uwdwld5yr8m8fgn7su955zf5qahtrgljqfjfa4nr8jfsj4alxk Enterprise Address : addr_test1vpq5qjr774cyc6kxcwp060k4t4hwp42q43v35lmcg3gcyccuxhdka You can now send and receive Ada using the above addresses. Note that Enterprise Address will not take part in staking. Wallet will be automatically registered on chain if you choose to delegate or pledge wallet when registering a stake pool. 5. Send some money to this wallet. Either through the faucet or have a friend send you some. !> The wallet must have funds in it before you can proceed. Create Pool \u2693\ufe0e 1.

Enter values that are useful to you. !> Make sure you set your pledge low enough to insure your funds in your wallet will cover pledge plus pool registration fees. 5. Select wallet to use as pledge wallet, Test in our case. As this is a newly created wallet you will be prompted to press a key to continue with wallet registration. When complete and if successful, both wallet and pool will be registered on-chain. It will look something like this: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> POOL >> REGISTER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Online mode - The default mode to use if all keys are available Hybrid mode - 1) Go through the steps to build a transaction file 2) Copy the built tx file to an offline node 3) Sign it using 'Sign Tx' with keys on offline node (CNTools started in offline mode '-o' without node connection) 4) Copy the signed tx file back to the online node and submit using 'Submit Tx' Selected value: [o] Online # Select pool Selected pool: TEST # Pool Parameters press enter to use default value Pledge (in Ada, default: 50,000): Margin (in %, default: 7.5): Cost (in Ada, minimum: 340, default: 340): # Pool Metadata Enter Pool's JSON URL to host metadata file - URL length should be less than 64 chars (default: https://foo.bat/poolmeta.json): Enter Pool's Name (default: TEST): Enter Pool's Ticker , should be between 3-5 characters (default: TEST): Enter Pool's Description (default: No Description): Enter Pool's Homepage (default: https://foo.com): Optionally set an extended metadata URL?

CNTools is like a swiss army knife for pool operators to simplify typical operations regarding their wallet keys and pool management. Please note that this tool is tested on Linux platforms only at this point and should NOT act as an excuse for Pool Operators to skip reading about how Staking works or basics of Linux operations. The skills highlighted on the home page are paramount for a stake pool operator, and so is the understanding of configuration files and network. Please ensure you've read and understood the disclaimers before proceeding. Visit the Changelog section to see progress and current release. Overview Download and Update Navigation Hardware Wallet Offline Workflow Start CNTools in Online Mode Start CNTools in Offline Mode Overview \u2693\ufe0e The tool consist of three files. * cntools.sh - the main script to launch cntools. * cntools.library - internal script with helper functions. * cntools.config - configuration file to modify certain behaviours, paths and name schema used. In addition to the above files, there is also a dependency on the common env file. CNTools connects to your node through the configuration in the env file located in the same directory as the script. Customize env and cntools.config files for your needs. CNTools can operate in an Offline mode without node access by providing the -o runtime argument. This launches CNTools with a limited set of features. * Online - When all wallet and pool keys are available on the hot node, use this option. * Hybrid - Option on hot node with offline workflow in mind when the signing keys are kept off the hot node to create an offline transaction file. * Offline - When CNTools is launched with -o runtime argument. Mainly used to access Transaction >> Sign to sign an offline transaction file created in Hybrid mode. cncli.sh is a companion script with optional functionalities to run on the core node (block producer) such as monitoring created blocks, calculating leader schedules and block validation. logMonitor.sh is another companion script meant to be run together with the cncli.sh script to give a more complete picture. See CNCLI and Log Monitor sections for more details. The tool in its default state uses the folder structure here . Everyone is free to customise, but while doing so beware that you may introduce changes that were not tested. !> It is important that you familiarise yourself with the usage using Testnet network (on a seperate machine) first, read the warnings/messages, maintain your keys and backups with passwords (no one other than yourself can retrieve the funds if you make an accident), before performing actions on mainnet. Download and Update \u2693\ufe0e The update functionality is provided from within CNTools. In case of breaking changes, please follow the prompts post-upgrade. If stuck, it's always best to re-run the latest prereqs.sh before proceeding. !> If you have not updated in a while, it is possible that you might come from a release with breaking changes. If so, please be sure to check out the upgrade instructions. Navigation \u2693\ufe0e The scripts menu supports both arrow key navigation and shortcut key selection. The character within the square brackets is the shortcut to press for quick navigation. For other selections like wallet and pool menu that don't contain shortcuts, there is a third way to navigate. Key pressed is compared to the first character of the menu option and if there is a match the selection jumps to this location. A handy way to quickly navigate a large menu. Hardware Wallet \u2693\ufe0e CNTools include hardware wallet support since version 7.0.0 through Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli application. Initialize and update firmware/app on the device to the latest version before usage following the manufacturer instructions. To enable hardware support run prereqs.sh -w . This downloads and installs Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli including udev configuration. When a new version of Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli is released, run prereqs.sh -w again to update. For additional runtime options, run prereqs.sh -h . Ledger Supported devices: Nano S / Nano X Make sure the latest cardano app is installed on the device. Trezor Supported devices: Model T Make sure the latest firmware is installed on the device. In addition to this, install Trezor Bridge for your system before trying to use your Trezor device in CNTools. You can find the latest version of the bridge at https://wallet.trezor.io/#/bridge Offline Workflow \u2693\ufe0e CNTools can be run in online and offline mode. At a very high level, for working with offline devices, remember that you need to use CNTools in an online node to generate a staging transaction for the desired type of transaction, and then move the staging transaction to an offline node to sign (authorize) using the signing keys on your offline node - and then bring back the signed transaction to the online node for submission to the chain. For the offline workflow, all the wallet and pool keys should be kept on the offline node. The backup function in CNTools has an option to create a backup without private keys (sensitive signing keys) to be transferred to online node. All other files are included in the backup to be transferred to the online node. Keys excluded from backup when created without private keys: Wallet - payment.skey , stake.skey Pool - cold.skey Note that setting up an offline server requires good SysOps background (you need to be aware of how to set up your server with offline mirror repository, how to transfer files across and be fairly familiar with the disk layout of guild tools). The prereqs.sh in its current state is not expected to run on an offline machine. Essentially, you simply need the cardano-cli , bech32 , cardano-address binaries in your $PATH , OS level dependency packages [ jq , coreutils , pkgconfig , gcc-c++ and bc ], and perhaps a copy from your online cnode directory (to ensure you have the right genesis / config files on your offline server). We strongly recommend you to familiarise yourself with the workflow on the testnet / guild networks first, before attempting on mainnet.

Guild LiveView - gLiveView is a local monitoring tool to use in addition to remote monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Zabbix or IOG's RTView. This is especially useful when moving to a systemd deployment - if you haven't done so already - as it offers an intuitive UI to monitor the node status. The tool is independent from other files and can run as a standalone utility that can be stopped/started without affecting the status of cardano-node . Download \u2693\ufe0e If you've used prereqs.sh , you can skip this part, as this is already set up for you. The tool relies on the common env configuration file. To get current epoch blocks, the logMonitor.sh script is needed (and can be combined with CNCLI ). This is optional and Guild LiveView will function without it. ?> For those who follow guild's folder structure and do not wish to run prereqs.sh , you can run the below in $CNODE_HOME/scripts folder To download the script: curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh curl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env chmod 755 gLiveView.sh Configuration & Startup \u2693\ufe0e For most setups, it's enough to set CNODE_PORT in the env file. The rest of the variables should automatically be detected. If required, modify User Variables in env and gLiveView.sh to suit your environment. For most standard deployments, this should lead you to a stage where you can now start running ./gLiveView.sh in the folder you downloaded the script (the default location would be $CNODE_HOME/scripts ). Note that the script is smart enough to automatically detect when you're running as a Core or Relay and will show fields accordingly. The tool can be run in legacy mode with only standard ASCII characters for terminals with trouble displaying the box-drawing characters. Run ./gLiveView.sh -h to show available command-line parameters or permanently set it directly in script. A sample output from both core and relay (with peer analysis): ** Core ** \u2693\ufe0e ** Relay ** \u2693\ufe0e Description \u2693\ufe0e Upper main section Displays live metrics gathered from EKG. Epoch number and progress is live from the node while date calculation until epoch boundary is based on offline genesis parameters. Reference tip is also an offline calculation based on genesis values used to compare against the node tip to see how far of the tip (diff value) the node is. With current parameters a slot diff up to 40 from reference tip is considered good but it should usually stay below 30. In/Out peers show how many connections the node has established in and out. Core section If the node is run as a core, identified by the 'forge-about-to-lead' EKG parameter, a second core section is displayed. This section contain current and remaining KES periods as well as a calculated date for the expiration. When getting close to expire date the values will change color. Blocks created by the node since node start is another metric shown in this section. If CNCLI is activated to store blocks created in a blocklog DB, data from this blocklog is displayed. If not, blocks created values are taken from EKG metrics. Peer analysis A manual peer analysis can be triggered by key press p . A latency test will be done on incoming and outgoing connections to the node. Outgoing connections(peers in topology file), ping type used is done in this order: 1. cncli - If available, this gives the most accurate measure as it checks the entire handshake process against the remote peer. 2. ss - Sends a TCP SYN package to ping the remote peer on the cardano-node port. Should give ~100% success rate. 2. tcptraceroute - Same as ss. 3. ping - fallback method using ICMP ping against IP. Will only work if firewall of remote peer accept ICMP traffic. For incoming connections, only ICMP ping is used as remote peer port is unknown. It's not uncommon to see many undetermined peers for incoming connections as it's a good security practice to disable ICMP in firewall. Once the analysis is finished, it will display the RTTs (return-trip times) for the peers and group them in ranges 0-50, 50-100, 100-200, 200<. The analysis is NOT live. Press [h] Home to go back to default view or [i] Info to show in-script help text. Up and Down arrow keys is used to select incoming or outgoing detailed list of IPs and their RTT value. Left (<) and Right (>) arrow keys can be used to navigate the pages in the selected list. Troubleshooting/Customisations \u2693\ufe0e In case you run into trouble while running the script, you might want to edit env & gLiveView.sh and look at User Variables section.

This \"TopologyUpdater\" service, which is far from being perfect due to its centralization factor, is intended to be a temporary solution to allow everyone to activate their relay nodes without having to postpone and wait for manual topology completion requests. The topologyUpdater shell script must be executed on the relay node as a cronjob exactly every 60 minutes . After 4 consecutive requests (3 hours) the node is considered a new relay node in listed in the topology file. If the node is turned off, it's automatically delisted after 3 hours. !> Note: You should NOT set up topologyUpdater for your block producing nodes. Download and Configure topologyUpdater.sh \u2693\ufe0e If you have run prereqs.sh , this should already be available in your scripts folder and make this step unnecessary. Before the updater can make a valid request to the central topology service, it must query the current tip/blockNo from the well-synced local node. It connects to your node through the configuration in the script as well as the common env configuration file. Customize these files for your needs.

How are the peers for my topology file selected? \u2693\ufe0e We calculate the distance on the Earth's surface from your node's IP to all subscribed peers. We then order the peers by distance (closest first) and start by selecting one peer. We then skip some, pick the next, skip, pick, skip, pick ... until we reach the end of the list (furthest away).

The operators can define their operational costs in the pool certificate, that can be deducted from the rewards. The objectives are the following: - Understand off-chain operational key certificates , - the required keys and addresses, - payment key(s) for generating base payment addresses, - stake key(s) for generating pool reward address(es) , - the stake address registration process with key deposit and - the stake pool registration procedure /w pledge and other params. Detailed steps are: - Run a node with an operational key certificate - Create stake key registration certificate for registering the operator's stake key ( staking.key ) on the chain, then - Create a pool registration certificate for the node to became a stake pool ( pool.cert ), - Create a delegation certificate for the owner (operator in our exercise) to delegate its stake as pledge to the newly creating pool ( deleg.cert ). - Sends the on-chain certificates to the blockchain in one or more transactions. Run a node with Operational Key Certificate \u2693\ufe0e The operational key certificates use an operational key (cold) key to grant the right to sign blocks to another key (KES) that will expire after some epochs, that is based on the genesis parameters. It uses a similar mechanism to the forward secure signature scheme where the signing key (KES) changes over time period and the end of each time period a new signing key is computed for the next peried and the old one is erased. The mechanism used for running a node with operational key certificates are the following: 1. KES (Key Evolving Signatures) that creates new (hot) KES keys periodically from the cold key - Create the cold (offline) key pair, - Create the hot KES key pairs (periodically), for signing blocks. - Create the operational key certificate 2. Generate VRF key pair for leader selection (lottery). 3. Run stake pool that is using the - non expired Operational certificate - non expired KES (hot) signing key - VRF signing key Before the old hot (KES) key pair is expiring, a new operational key certificate needs to be created by using a newly generated hot (KES) key pair and the off-line cold signing key. In production environment, it is expected that the cold key is generated by some seed generation mechanism (BIP39 or similar) and stored on computer that does not have access to the Internet and when the time arrives, the operational certificates with the hot (KES) key pairs are transferred, by some mechanism (USB stick, air gapped QR etc.) to the stake pool. # 1.1 Create cold key pair ########################################## pushd $CNODE_HOME && mkdir -p ~/cold-keys && pushd ~/cold-keys || exit 127 # Generate the cold offline key pair cardano-cli shelley node key-gen \\ --verification-key-file cold.vkey \\ --signing-key-file cold.skey \\ --operational-certificate-issue-counter cold.counter popd # 1.2 Generate a new hot KES keypair cardano-cli shelley node key-gen-KES --verification-key-file priv/kes.vkey --signing-key-file priv/kes.skey # 1.3 Generate the ops cert based on # - the `cold signing key` # - the hot KES key and # - the cold key's counter # New periodic cert is based on the new hot KES key. # kes-period tells how long the ops cert therefrore the hot KES keys are valid # cardano-cli shelley node issue-op-cert \\ --cold-signing-key-file ~/cold-keys/cold.skey \\ --operational-certificate-issue-counter ~/cold-keys/cold.counter \\ --hot-kes-verification-key-file priv/kes.vkey \\ --kes-period 0 \\ --out-file priv/op.cert # 2.

It uses a similar mechanism to the forward secure signature scheme where the signing key (KES) changes over time period and the end of each time period a new signing key is computed for the next peried and the old one is erased. The mechanism used for running a node with operational key certificates are the following: 1. KES (Key Evolving Signatures) that creates new (hot) KES keys periodically from the cold key - Create the cold (offline) key pair, - Create the hot KES key pairs (periodically), for signing blocks. - Create the operational key certificate 2.

Container breakouts: Caused when the user is able to escape the container namespace and interact with other processes on the host. Denial-of-service attacks: Occur when some containers take up enough resources to hamper the functioning of other applications. Poisoned images: Caused when an untrusted image is being run and a hacker is able to access application data and, potentially, the host itself. Docker containers are now being exploited to covertly mine for cryptocurrency, marking a shift from ransomware to cryptocurrency malware. As with all things in security, also Docker security is a moving target \u2014 so it\u2019s helpful to have access to up-to-date information, including experience-based best practices, for securing your containerized environments. Here below some key concepts: \u2693\ufe0e Use a Third-Party Security Tool Docker allows you to use containers from untrusted public repositories, which increases the need to scrutinize whether the container was created securely and whether it is free of any corrupt or malicious files. For this, use a multi-purpose security tool that gives extensive dev-to-production security controls.(keep reading below) Manage Vulnerability It is best to have a sound vulnerability management program that has multiple checks throughout the container lifecycle. Vulnerability management should incorporate quality gates to detect access issues and weaknesses for a potential exploit from dev-to-production environments. Monitor and Audit Container Activity It is vital to monitor the container ecosystem and detect suspicious activity. Container monitoring activities provide real-time reports that can help you react promptly to a security breach. Enable Docker Content Trust Docker Content Trust is a new feature incorporated into Docker 1.8. It is disabled by default, but once enabled, allows you to verify the integrity, authenticity, and publication date of all Docker images from the Docker Hub Registry. Use Docker Bench for Security You should consider Docker Bench for Security as your must-use script. Once the script is run, you will notice a lot of information regarding configuration best practices for deploying Docker containers that can be used to further secure your Docker server and containers. Resource Utilization To reduce performance impacts and denial-of-service attacks, it is a good practice to implement limits on the system resources that the containers can consume. If, for example, a web server is compromised, it helps to limit the impact to the other processes that are running on a host. RBAC RBAC is role-based access control. If you have multiple users accessing you enviroment, this is a must-have. It can be quite expensive to implement but portainer makes it super easy. Security Docker best practice: \u2693\ufe0e The Guild Docker images are not using all the following tips due to functional purpose \u2693\ufe0e Guild tips: - NEVER NEVER NEVER expose Docker API publicly!!! (disabled by default) Keep Docker Host Up-to-date Reverse uptime: containers that are frequently shut down and replaced by new container are more difficult for hackers to attack. Use a Firewall or Expose only the ports you need to be public. Use a * Reverse Proxy Do not Change ** Docker Socket Ownership Do not Run Docker Containers as Root Use Trusted Docker Images Use Privileged Mode Carefully (This is usually done by adding --privileged you can use --security-opt=no-new-privileges instead) Some more general tips: - Restrict container capabilities: \"--cap-drop ALL\" - Use Docker Secrets - Change DOCKER_OPTS to ***Respect IP Table Firewall - Control Docker Resource Usage - Rate Limit : is quite common to mitigate brute force or denial of service attacks. - Fail2ban : Fail2ban scans your log files and bans IP address that shows malicious intent - Container Vulnerability Scanner Notes: \u2693\ufe0e *Nginx is a very good choice as load balancer and/or reverse proxy. **By default the socket is owned by root user and docker group. *** On Ubuntu/Debian based systems, edit /etc/default/docker and add the following line: DOCKER_OPTS= \"--iptables=false\"","title":"Docker Security best practice"},{"location":"docker/docker_security/#docker-security-best-practice","text":"","title":"Docker Security best practice"},{"location":"docker/docker_security/#intro","text":"On the security front, Docker developers are faced with different types of security attacks such as: Kernel exploits: Since the host\u2019s kernel is shared in the container, a compromised container can attack the entire host.
