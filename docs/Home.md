### Welcome!!

This documentation (rather the repository itself) is created by some of the community members and serves as an easy means to add documentation or scripts that makes more sense to users. The target audience for this document are mainly experienced stake pool operators.

The repository is already open to collaboration from many members within community. We would love community contributions and verification of the instructions, rather than having 100 versions of documentations. If there are any discrepancies/suggestions/contributions for this document, please open a issue and one of the collaborators should be able to add the changes in.

#### Getting started with Haskell Node

Use the sidebar to navigate through the topics. Note that the instructions assume the folder structure as per Next topic, you're expected to update the folder reference as per your environment.
Also, since you cannot run a Praos node yet, the instructions here-in allow you to join a private haskell testnet network (phtn), we will gradually update to Praos version and update the phtn references.

*Note that the shelley (Praos) codebase is still being cooked in the oven while we're trying to taste it, expect hand burns if not careful
Since we're just trying to keep up with codebase, expect rapid changes (some breaking, requiring redo of network - but that's always the intent of keeping up with bleeding tech). Feedback/Contribution and ownership of tasks is always welcome
